# 🫁 Lung Disease Detection using Deep Learning and Computer Vision

This project aims to detect and classify lung diseases using chest X-ray images by applying deep learning techniques. The model helps in identifying conditions such as **Bacterial Pneumonia**, **Viral Pneumonia**, **COVID-19**, and **Normal (Healthy Lungs)** with good accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image classification.
- Classifies X-rays into:
  - Normal
  - Bacterial Pneumonia
  - Viral Pneumonia
  - COVID-19
- Evaluated using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, **ROC curve**, and **AUC**.
- Supports easy visualization of model performance.
